    <p>This page can hold your full coaching story, background, philosophy, qualifications, or anything that expresses why you do what you do. It’s meant to be warm, direct, and grounded. Replace this placeholder text when you're ready.</p>

    <p>You might want to include your approach, what clients can expect when they work with you, and the values that guide your practice. You can also include a professional photo later.</p>
