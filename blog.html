        <h2>The Strength In Slowing Down</h2>
        <p class="meta">12 November 2025</p>
        <p>Most of us spend our days chasing momentum — ticking boxes, juggling lists, staying busy enough to feel like we’re getting somewhere. But real strength isn’t always in motion. Sometimes it’s found in stillness, in the space between one thing and the next.
            When we slow down, we start to notice what’s actually driving us: the thoughts that keep looping, the pressure we put on ourselves, the small wins we forget to recognise. Slowing down doesn’t mean doing less; it means doing things with more awareness.
            If you find yourself running on autopilot, try pausing — properly. Step outside, feel the air, breathe in deliberately. That small moment of grounding resets more than your body; it clears the fog from your thoughts.
            In coaching sessions, this pause becomes powerful. It’s where people rediscover the ability to choose — what to prioritise, what to release, and what truly matters.There’s strength in slowing down. 
            It’s not giving up pace; it’s finding your own rhythm again.</p>

        <h2>Tiny Habits, Real Change</h2>
        <p class="meta">19 November 2025</p>
        <p>When we think about changing our lives, most of us imagine big leaps — new routines, new careers, complete transformations. But real change usually starts smaller than that.
            The smallest habits are often the most powerful because they’re sustainable. One glass of water before coffee. A five-minute walk between meetings. Writing a single sentence in a journal rather than a full page. These moments seem tiny, but they begin to shift your relationship with discipline, self-trust, and energy.
            In coaching, I often see people wait for the “right moment” to start something new. The truth is, the right moment appears once you’ve already started.
            Choose one small thing today — something kind to yourself, something achievable. Do it again tomorrow. And again the day after. Momentum doesn’t come from motivation; it comes from repetition.
            Small steps don’t look impressive, but they quietly build a stronger foundation — the kind that lasts.</p>
